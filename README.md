- ⚡ Fun fact: Secondary education in an educational institution does not have a special priority in achieving success in personal life, in professional activities, and in fulfilling one's mission.
 
The basic function and foundation in education is formed in elementary grades and depends on the individual desire of everyone to analyze a huge amount of information in order to make correctly adaptive decisions. I am sure it is necessary to work on yourself daily, to develop your personality in such areas as self-development, self-education, and the acquisition of new knowledge. Timely assimilation of the information of our time is the foundation of our society. To have a status in society based on the fulfillment of their mission.

P.S. This is my civic position.
